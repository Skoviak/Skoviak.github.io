# Skoviak.github.io
Development website.

This is a demo of a project that I created using PHP Storm, MySQL Workbench and XAMPP. The github page contains HTML, CSS and jQuery, but the full project includes PHPâ€”primarily to pull down info from a database (using MySQLi, but I am familiar with PDO, too). e.g. to dynamically add new albums to the appropriate genre page or to query the database with what the user entered into the search field.

There is also a basic data entry page for inserting new albums, artists and genres into the database (with auto-populated lists of artits and genres for new albums), but it has no security. I have also implemeneted a basic post/redirect/get loop for the data entry.
